WSGI: The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a simple calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications or frameworks written in the Python programming language.
 
 mod_wsgi: mod_wsgi is an Apache HTTP Server module by Graham Dumpleton that provides a WSGI compliant interface for hosting Python based web applications under Apache.
 
 installing mod_wsgi for python3: 
 
    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
    
  Once the installation is done. go to "/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf" and add the following code:
  
  <VirtualHost *:80>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to

        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/webapp
        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/webapp/webapp/wsgi.py

        ErrorLog /var/www/html/logs/error.log
        CustomLog /var/www/html/logs/custom.log combined
</VirtualHost>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
  
  create logs folder in the /var/www/html/logs
  
 Add the following our application python path to the file " apache2.conf"
 
   WSGIPythonPath /var/www/html/webapp
   
   
   Now we integrated our python web application with Apache web server. Now run the public DNS, Our application will be shown.
